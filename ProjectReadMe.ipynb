    "\n",
    "After exploring and analyzing the given data sets I chose to focus on an approach that measured films box office success by calculating film profit (subtracting film budget from film gross) and film profit quotient (dividing film budget from film gross). Once I obtained film profit and profit quotient I compared them to several other variables such as genre, rating, and release month that a studio chooses when producing a film. My hypothesis is that by filtering variables through profit correlation a studio will maximize the return on investment of its films. "
